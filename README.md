# Introduction

Ever since discovering [Maths Town](https://www.youtube.com/@MathsTown) Mandelbrot [zooms](https://mathigon.org/step/talks/mandel-zoom) on YouTube, I've been obsessed with fractals and other mathematical media generation. The problem is: I'm shit at math. These experiments are a fusion of my life-long Java skills, and my weird-ass prompts to [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### Why the name Grogu?

Grogu is a character in the show The Mandalorian. Mandalorian -> Mandal. Mandal -> Mandel. Mandelbrot. Fractals. Yes.

## Features to come:

- [x] Generate a Mandelbrot!
- [ ] More options to tweak generation (currently most are hardcoded)
- [ ] Save to image file
- [ ] Zooming, re-positioning, rotating
- [ ] Custom colour palettes
- [ ] Julia sets
- *This list is very early and non-exhaustive.*
